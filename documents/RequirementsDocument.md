## 2.2 Use Cases

Thre are two types of users of this application; students and faculty. Students have the ability to apply for open TA positions and delete pending applications. Faculty can create TA positions and assign applicants (students) to those positions.

| Use case # 1      |   |
| ------------------ |--|
| Name              | Create Student Account  |
| Users             | Student  |
| Rationale         | Students can create an account with their information to apply for TA positions  |
| Triggers          | User selects Student Registration option |
| Preconditions     | Student is on Login page and no user is currently logged in |
| Actions           | 1. Student indicates software should open "Student Registration".  <br /> 2.

In step 3, the user may input invalid information. In this case the software will flash a warning to the user and will not continue to step 4 until the input has been corrected.  |
| Postconditions    | The user is logged-in with their new account and the account has been added to the database. The main page is displayed.  |
| Acceptance tests  | 1. There are no repeats of faculty account with same WSU email <br /> 2. Faculty account is created successfully <br /> 3. All faculty information is included in the account. <br /> 4. Faculty can successfully login to their account after registration  |

| Alternative paths | 1. In Step 2 the system may find the that given credentials are not correct in which case the system should return to the precondition state and warn the user that the given information is incorrect.   |
| Postconditions    | The user has been logged in  |
| Acceptance tests  | Can see the correct account upon logging in with proper credentials or the login page when using incorrect credentials  |
| Iteration         | Iteration #1  |

| Actions           | 1. The user indicates that the software should open an application for the specified TA position. <br /> 2. The software responds with opening the application and prompting the user for information. <br /> 3. The user inputs the information and indicates that the software should submit the information.<br /> 4. The software adds a new application that can be viewed by the course instructor and adds the application to the database.<br /> 5.

âA student applies to a research position; initially its status will appear as âPendingâ. The faculty who created that position reviews the application and updates the application status to either âApproved for Interviewâ, or âHiredâ, or âNot hiredâ. The updated status of the application is displayed on the student view.
The student may delete the pending applications (i.e., whose status is still âPendingâ. )â
